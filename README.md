## 2. My process

### 2.1 Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- Font Awesome (icons)
- CSS
- Flexbox (Layout)
- Desktop-first workflow

### 2.2 What I learned

#### 2.2.1 Use of the Git version management system

##### Configuration
> git config --global user.name "John Doe"  
> git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

##### Main commands
> git init  
> git remote add origin url  
> git add  
> git commit -m "message"  
> git push origin main/branch

##### Branches
> *(See branches)* git branch  
> *(Switch branch)* git checkout branchname  
> *(Merge branch)* git merge branchname  
> *(Remove local)* git branch -d branchname  
> *(Remove remote)* git branch -D branchname  

##### Commits
> *(See last commits)* git log commit  
> *(Correct last commit)* git commit --amend -m "new message"  
> *(If forgotten file in last commit)* git add file then git commit --amend --no-edit  

##### Deploy a website on GitHub Pages

#### 2.2.2 Integrate content according to a mockup
- Reproduce a structure in HTML5
- Layout an HTML page with CSS;

#### 2.2.3 Implement a responsive interface (Media queries for cell phones, and tablets)

### 2.3 Continued development
- Define css variables for better visibility and easier maintenance
- Use CSS Grid instead of Flexbox
- Try a mobile-first workflow

### 2.4 Useful ressources
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) - This helped me understand the Git workflow, learn Markdown and document my projects
- [The Art of Comments](https://css-tricks.com/the-art-of-comments/) - This article allowed me to understand the importance of comments and gives keys to ensuring their relevance.
